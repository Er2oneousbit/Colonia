/**
 * simulate.mjs - headless balance simulation
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Builds the demo city on a map and fast-forwards, printing one line of city
 * statistics per month, then a summary (fires, ratings, raids, crime,
 * health and disease, money). Use it to check balance changes without playing.
 *
 * Money: the city starts with SIM_MONEY so that it never feels poverty (a city
 * in debt cannot build, and favor falls), and the report says what it would
 * have needed instead: the most it was ever out of pocket (building plus the
 * running losses before it pays its way) against what the difficulty gives,
 * and the month it would have gone into debt. `npm run sweep` compares that
 * across difficulties and missions.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/simulate.mjs [--scenario c1] [--type river] [--size 64]
 *                             [--seed demo] [--years 3] [--level 2]
 *                             [--difficulty normal] [--json]
 *   npm run sim -- --years 5
 *   npm run sim -- --difficulty insane --raids frequent --garrison
 *   npm run sim -- --pace       (how long the campaign's goals take, no city)
 *   npm run sim -- --capacity   (how many people each mission's buildings employ, no city)
 *   npm run sim -- --scenario c1 --unlocks --homes 40   (mission 1 as a player could build it)
 *   npm run sim -- --type coast --seed beach --years 4 --harbor   (sea trade: ships' stays at the dock)
 *   npm run sim -- --type coast --fishing 2   (two fishing wharves and a shipyard: fish a year per wharf)
 *   npm run sim -- --level 3 --venues --hippodrome   (the big venues and the hippodrome: entertainment scores)
 *   npm run sim -- --size 96 --level 3 --uptown --cloth --years 5   (Insulae, with clothing from the cloth industry)
 *   npm run sim -- --size 96 --level 3 --uptown --cloth --cloth-off 36 --years 5   (and when it stops)
 *   npm run sim -- --size 192 --level 3 --uptown --cloth --blocks 6 --villas 1 --raids off --years 12
 *                              (a city of six blocks and a villa quarter: the capacity model against play)
 *   npm run sim -- --type coast --raids frequent --garrison --navy --years 8   (sea raids against a fleet)
 *   npm run sim -- --type coast --raids frequent --garrison --navy --academy --years 8   (and training)
 *   npm run sim -- --events off   (no events: the city as before they existed)
 *   npm run sim -- --events wages,clay   (the sandbox with only these random events switched on)
 *   npm run sim -- --scenario c10p --years 10   (a mission's events: Puteoli's earthquake in its 8th year)
 *   npm run sim -- --level 3 --years 6 --monument basilica   (a monument: how long it takes, what it costs)
 *
 * Campaign runs build every building unless --unlocks is given (then only
 * what the mission unlocks), so their numbers stay comparable with earlier
 * sweeps; a sandbox unlocks everything, so --unlocks changes nothing there.

Headless balance simulation

  node scripts/simulate.mjs [options]

Options:
  --scenario <id>   campaign scenario id (c1, c2, then c3 to c10 with a sibling each: c3m, c4p...
                    c10m, c10p) instead of a sandbox map
  --unlocks         build only what the mission unlocks (campaign runs build everything without it)
  --homes <n>       at most n housing plots, to size the town to its jobs (default: the whole site)
  --type <t>        sandbox landscape: river | coast | lakes | plains | desert (default river)
  --size <n>        sandbox map size (default 64; Uber is 256)
  --difficulty <d>  easy | normal | hard | insane (default normal)
  --seed <s>        map seed (default "demo")
  --years <n>       years to simulate (default 3)
  --level <1-3>     demo city complexity (default 2)
  --garrison        also build a barracks, forts, towers and a wall (equipped); while enemies are
                    ashore every fort is deployed onto the one nearest the city, as a player would
                    (forts at rest only hold their ground), and recalled when they are gone
  --harbor [docks]  after 6 months, a Dock (or this many) and a warehouse by the water, every sea
                    route open; the warehouse gets 300 pottery, furniture and oil a month for
                    export (the demo city makes none). Reports ships' stays and trade a year
  --natives         (sandbox) native villages on the map (sim/natives.js; Mutina and Luna always
                    have them). Runs with villages report a Natives: line: attacks, villagers slain,
                    buildings torn down, villages calmed and their trade (the demo city builds no
                    mission post, so nothing calms them)
  --low-bridge      with --harbor, then a Pons Sublicius (Low Bridge) between the sea entry and the
                    docks, the first straight crossing that cuts one off: no ship gets past it
  --fishing <n>     also build a shipyard and n fishing wharves (and a granary by them); the
                    shipyard starts with 400 timber (the demo city fells none)
  --venues          also build an amphitheater, a colosseum, a gladiator school and a menagerie
  --hippodrome      also build a hippodrome and a chariot maker
  --uptown          lift the homes toward the Insula: plazas, statues, a library, baths, the big
                    venues, vegetable farms; markets get pottery, furniture and oil every month
                    (a stand-in for those industries). Everything an Insula needs but clothing
  --cloth           also build the cloth industry: a flax farm, a linen maker, a clothing maker
  --cloth-off <m>   demolish the cloth industry after month m (homes lose their clothing)
  --blocks <n>      (level 3) a city of n blocks like the first, each with its own uptown and cloth
                    when asked, and workshops for its goods (furniture, oil) beside the potter
  --villas <n>      (level 3) also n villa blocks: services in the outer bands, homes in the inner
                    ones, wine for their markets (a stand-in for a winery, which is built too)
  --wine            (level 3, --uptown) wine for every market each month (a stand-in for a winery,
                    which is built too, and imports): the best-served homes may become villas.
                    With --blocks, --villas or --wine the run reports the share of people in
                    villas and the capacity model's jobs and unemployment for that city
                    (sim/capacity.js) beside the sim's
  --caretaker       rebuild whatever burns or collapses, as a player would (npm run sweep)
  --salary          the governor draws his rank's salary from the treasury (default: none, so the
                    money and favor reported are the city's own)
  --raids <mode>    off | occasional | frequent (overrides the scenario)
  --sea-raids <s>   on | off: the Sea raids switch (default on: some raids come by sea where ships can sail)
  --people <p>      who raids: site (the province's own people) or a people of src/data/peoples.js
                    (gauls, boii, ligurians, carthaginians, lusitanians, cimbri...). Default: a
                    mission's own people, the sandbox's generic band
  --wolves [on|off] wolf packs on the map (default: a mission's own, none in the sandbox).
                    Reports the packs, wolves killed and walkers lost to them
  --events <s>      on | off | a list: the province's events (default on: the sandbox's random events, a
                    mission's random and scheduled ones, sim/events.js). Off plays as before events
                    existed. A comma list (wages,land,sea,water,mine,clay, or none) is the sandbox
                    setup's switches left on; a mission keeps its own events
  --festivals <s>   on | off (default on): from 800 people (where the gods mind being forgotten) the
                    demo city holds a small festival whenever the cooldown allows and it can spare
                    the food, for the god longest without one; off holds none. The Gods: line
                    reports the gods' moods, blessings, wraths and festivals
  --games           hold Ludi at a Great Arena and Circenses at the hippodrome whenever each can be
                    held (sim/games.js: cooldown, a staffed venue with shows, money); the Games: line
                    reports how many and what they cost
  --navy            also build a naval station and a navalia, stocked for a squadron (where ships can sail)
  --academy         with --garrison also a Military Academy, with --navy also a Portus (training: who is trained)
  --academy-late <m>  with --garrison, a Military Academy built at the start of month m instead, once
                    the forts are full of untrained men, and military labor put first so it is
                    fully staffed: the men at rest go to train (sim/training.js), one fort's man at
                    a time. The Training: line says when it was built
  --legion <m>      Caesar's legions arrive at the start of month m (the size of a first attack, or
                    --legion-size n), with favor held at 5 so they attack; a Governor's House goes up
                    with the city. Reports the fight: men killed, soldiers lost, buildings lost, the
                    residence, and whether the city was overrun (a mission's loss)
  --monument <key>  in month 12 (or --monument-month m), a monument's site beside the city (the
                    Pharus on the shore), a work camp near it with a well, and a warehouse by the
                    camp, kept stocked each month with what the stage under way still needs (a
                    stand-in for the quarries, workshops and imports; reported at import prices).
                    Keys: fanum_ceres (and the other gods), pantheum, pharus, mansio_magna,
                    thermae, basilica. Reports when each stage was done, the money, the goods, the
                    upkeep and the camp's staffing, food and water
  --json            print a JSON summary at the end
  --pace            print the campaign's pace (the fewest months each goal takes) and exit
  --capacity        print what each mission's buildings can employ (sim/capacity.js) and exit
  --verbose         print game messages as they happen
  --help            this help
