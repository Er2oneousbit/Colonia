  // Half a day: the original's prefect stands up to a day at each burning
  // tile, but a building here is its whole footprint, and a prefect called to
  // a block of homes should be done before the 6 days a ruin burns let the
  // flames heat their way through it (measured: see the commit).
  PREFECT_DOUSE_TICKS: 10,

  // building: unchecked, one street on fire drew 17 from one post.
  PREFECT_FIRE_CREW: 3,
  // Prefects against raiders and Caesar's legionaries (sim/prefectFight.js).
  // A prefect on his rounds stops and fights an enemy this close (tiles, from

  // cooldown ticks). Alone he loses to a raider (Normal: about 4 blows of ~10
  // kill him while he deals ~3.5 a blow to the raider's 70): prefects slow a

  // Homes sit within a few points of city mood (a target, not a running total
  // as in the original, whose homes spread from 0 to 100), so these bands are
  // set 5 higher than the original's 30 and 10: thieves come as a city nears
  // the mood where settlers stop coming (30), riots only under real neglect
  // (city mood around 15-20: in the demo city, taxes of 17% and more).
  THIEF_MOOD: 35, // below this: a thief
  RIOT_MOOD: 15, // at or below this, while city mood is under RIOT_CITY_MOOD: a riot

  // --- Health and disease (sim/disease.js) ----------------------------------
  // Every occupied home has a health score (0-100), from its level and what it
  // has: health care, baths, a barber, fountain water and food. The poorer

  // Measured on the balance sim's demo city (mood about 45; six seeds, Normal

  // above 30, where settlers keep coming and peace stops falling 2 a month.
  // (-8 and -15 took it to 28 on Hard and peace fell to 0.) The second wrath
