/**
 * revolt.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The gladiator revolt, as the original had it, on Colonia's units.
 *
 * A scheduled event (the events table, sim/events.js, calls startRevolt in
 * its month; the console's `revolt` does it now):
 *   - No working Ludus Gladiatorius (staffed, with a road) that month: the
 *     revolt is called off for good, with no word, as in the original.
 *   - Otherwise a message, and for REVOLT_MONTHS months every gladiator who
 *     sets out turns on the city: each performer on his way from a school
 *     to a venue with gladiators, and each entertainer walking the streets
 *     for a venue whose gladiator shows are booked, becomes a `gladiator`
 *     unit (data/units.js: 75 health, attack 12, the original's 100 / 9 / 2
 *     on Colonia's scale) where he stands. The schools keep training, so new
 *     ones keep turning as they set out (looked for each day).
 *   - Gladiators go for the nearest buildings as raiders do and break what
 *     they reach (sim/military.js updateRaider). Soldiers, watchtowers and
 *     prefects fight them; while they are in the province no peace is gained
 *     (side 'enemy': sim/ratings.js enemiesInProvince).
 *   - In the end month a message says the revolt is over, and the survivors
 *     run for the map edge (the original struck them all dead on the spot;
 *     Colonia lets them flee, for looks) and are gone.
 *
 * State, saved with the military (core/save.js):
 *   game.military.revolt = { endMonth, turned, buildingsLost, over } or null
 * (buildingsLost: what the rebels wrecked, kept apart from the raids' count;
 * their ruins read "torn down by rebel gladiators", sim/risk.js).
 * Each rebel is a unit with `revolt: true`.
