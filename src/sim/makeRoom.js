/**
 * makeRoom.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nobody is built over. A building or wall placed where soldiers, raiders,
 * wolves or villagers stand, or a walker off the roads (a rioter, a prefect
 * after him, a native trader), used to leave them inside it: drawn in its
 * walls and, a unit, unable to plan a route out, since a route never starts
 * inside a building (playtest: troops found standing under a new academy
 * when it was cleared). Now each steps aside, the moment it is built, to the
 * nearest tile he may stand on, keeping as much of his place in his tile as
 * he can (a shove, not a jump to the tile's middle). Placing is never
 * refused for them: they make room, as a crowd does for builders.
 *
 * A unit's own fort's yard is his to stand in (sim/forts.js yardSpot),
 * and ships never stand where anything is built. Walkers on the roads never
 * need this: nothing is built on a road. A soldier's spots and his fort's
 * gate need nothing either: they are worked out again whenever the map
 * changes (formationSpots, fortPost, fortGate key on map.revision), only
 * ever on open tiles.
