/**
 * bridges.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The low bridge and the boats it stops. Two bridges carry roads over water
 * (data/buildings.js TOOLS): the ship bridge, high on stone arches, and the
 * cheaper timber low bridge. Both are Road.BRIDGE tiles; a low bridge's are
 * also marked in map.bridgeLow (saved), so the walkers, soldiers and raiders
 * crossing either never need to tell them apart.
 *
 * No boat passes a low bridge: merchant ships, fishing boats, liburnians and
 * raider ships alike. The map splits its ships' and boats' water there
 * (world/map.js splitAtLowBridges), so every water route already planned by
 * body (sim/navy.js, sim/fishing.js) stays on its side; merchant ships route
 * over navigable water with the low bridges taken out (sim/trade.js
 * shipPath). A boat already under way when a low bridge goes up meets it on
 * its route and plans again from where it is (boatBlocked; sim/navy.js
 * followWaterPath for the warships and raider ships).
 *
 * As in the original, a low bridge may cut a dock off from the sea. The
 * original said nothing until a yearly "no working dock" message; Colonia
 * warns while the bridge is being placed (lowBridgeCuts) and the cut-off
 * building's panel says why no ship comes (cutOffNote).
 *
 * Colonia's own consequence: raider ships cannot pass a low bridge either,
 * so a low bridge below the city keeps them out of the upper river.
