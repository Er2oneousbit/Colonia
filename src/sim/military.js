/**

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Soldiers, raiders, towers, walls and invasions.
 *
 * Supply chain (carts deliver only while forts have empty places)
 *   Weaponsmith (iron)          ---weapons---\
 *   Fletcher (timber + iron)    ---arrows----+--> Barracks --recruit walks by road--> Fort
 *   Horse Ranch (breeding herd) ---horses----/
 *   Warehouses forward stored weapons/arrows to barracks too; horses stay at
 *   the ranch (never in a warehouse) until a barracks needs them.
 *   One recruit: legionary 50 weapons, archer 50 arrows, cavalryman 1 horse.
 *
 * Units (both sides) move freely over open land in continuous tile
 * coordinates (tile centers are at .5). Roman soldiers at rest stand in
 * their fort's yard, inside its walls; while enemies are about they stand
 * on formation spots by it, where they always stood (or around a rally point the player
 * picks). At the fort they hold their ground (fight only what comes to
 * them); deployed, they engage raiders around the rally point. Raiders follow a "flow field": one
 * Dijkstra pass from every building tile gives each land tile the cost to
 * reach the nearest building, so every raider just walks downhill. Walls cost
 * extra in that field, so raiders pick the cheapest place to break through.
 *
 * Invasions are announced in three stages (raidWarning below): word of a
 * warband about 6 months ahead, the scouts' report of its size and road
 * about 3 months ahead, and a last warning a month ahead. Then a warband
 * spawns at a map edge that can reach the city's homes. It flees when mostly destroyed, or
 * withdraws (with plunder if it reached the city) after a while, so an
 * undefended city is punished but not wiped out. Where ships can sail, about
 * a third of raids come by sea instead: raider ships put the warband ashore
 * near the city (sim/navy.js, which also runs the fleet). Ships are units
 * too (`naval`), but sail and fight apart: soldiers, raiders and towers on
 * land never see them.
