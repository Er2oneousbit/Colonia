/**
 * disease.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Health and disease: local outbreaks on the fire machinery (Colonia's own
 * design; not the original's city-wide plague).
 *
 * Health score (0-100), for every occupied home, from what it has:
 *   its level (up to HEALTH_LEVEL_MAX points), health care (a medicus visit
 *   and a hospital within reach HEALTH_CARE_BOTH, a hospital alone
 *   HEALTH_CARE_HOSPITAL, a medicus alone HEALTH_CARE_MEDICUS), baths,
 *   a barber, fountain water (a well does not count), HEALTH_PER_FOOD for each
 *   kind of food in the pantry; at most HEALTH_HUNGRY_MAX when its level eats
 *   and it has no food at all.
 *
 * Disease risk (daily, on the home's own tick, like fire risk). Not below
 * DISEASE_MIN_POP people, nor in a mission whose scenario says
 * `disease: false` (the first two):
 *   risk += DISEASE_RATE x (100 - score) / 100 x crowding x difficulty.disease
 *           x (0.6 to 1.4), halved within a staffed hospital's reach
 *   crowding = DISEASE_CROWD_BASE + min(DISEASE_CROWD_MAX, residents / DISEASE_CROWD_PEOPLE)
 * A physician passing by resets it to 0 (as a prefect resets fire risk). At
 * DISEASE_THRESHOLD a home has a DISEASE_OUTBREAK_CHANCE a day to fall sick.
 *
 * An outbreak: DISEASE_DEATHS of the residents die (DISEASE_DEATHS_HOSPITAL
 * within a hospital's reach), at least one; a home left empty becomes a
 * vacant lot. The rest are sick for SICK_DAYS: the home cannot move up and
 * takes in no settlers, and once a day every occupied home touching it gains
 * DISEASE_HEAT risk and has a DISEASE_SPREAD_CHANCE to fall sick at once
 * (halved within a hospital's reach). One chance a day per neighbor, however
 * many sick homes it touches: the lesson of updateFires, where rolling per
 * tile let one fire take a whole block.
 *
 * A physician who passes a sick home cures it. A staffed medicus near an
 * outbreak sends one, the way prefectures send prefects to fires: a
 * physician already on his rounds nearby is called over first. Otherwise
 * the home recovers by itself when its days run out.
 *
 * City health: monthly, HEALTH_STEP toward the residents' average score
 * (weighted by residents); it stays at HEALTH_START below DISEASE_MIN_POP
 * people. It is only shown: no rating, and not migration, reads it.
 *
 * Messages: at most one "Disease has broken out" pop-up a month; the month's
 * other outbreaks are summed up in one message at the start of the next.
