/**
 * battle.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Distant battles: Caesar asks the province for troops to defend a city of
 * the empire (data/battles.js), and the battle is fought BATTLE_MONTHS later.
 * The original's rules, in Colonia's units, with the fleet able to answer a
 * call to a city by the sea (Colonia's own).
 *
 * The request (monthly)
 *   A mission's scheduled events (data/scenarios.js distantBattles): in the
 *   mission's year `year`, in a month from Martius to October drawn from the
 *   map's seed on a stream of its own (the game's own random stream is never
 *   touched, so a city that is never asked plays exactly as before). The
 *   sandbox, with raids on: from SANDBOX_BATTLE_FROM months, each month a
 *   SANDBOX_BATTLE_CHANCE draw on that stream, picking the city and the
 *   enemy's strength. A request that comes while another battle is still
 *   being fought, its troops are on the road or its city is still in enemy
 *   hands is dropped, as in the original.
 *
 * Sending (the Imperial advisor; once per battle, while it is pending)
 *   Every fort whose Empire service switch is on sends all its soldiers, and,
 *   when the city lies on a sea route and the province's water reaches the
 *   sea, every Naval Station switched on sends its squadron. Their strength
 *   is fixed there and then: battleStrength (sim/training.js) of each man and
 *   ship. They leave the province at once (the march months stand for the
 *   whole way); their records travel with the troops (`sent.men`,
 *   `sent.ships`). Their places at home are kept: the barracks
 *   and the navalia do not fill them, and they are paid as before.
 *
 * The march (monthly while the battle is pending)
 *   At the start the troops are marchMonths away (the length of their way on
 *   the empire map). Each month they come a month nearer, and one more while
 *   they are farther off than the enemy is from the city (troops sent late
 *   catch up), never nearer than 1. The enemy waits at its gathering place
 *   until its own march (enemyMonths) must begin, and reaches the city in the
 *   battle's month.
 *
 * The battle (the month it is due), in this order:
 *   nobody sent                        lost: favor -25 (-10 with no soldier
 *                                      or ship in the city to send)
 *   troops more than BATTLE_IN_TIME away  lost, too late: favor -25; the
 *                                      troops turn back unharmed
 *   their strength under the enemy's   lost, too weak: favor -10, and every
 *                                      man and ship sent is lost
 *   otherwise                          won: favor +25 and the right to build
 *                                      one more triumphal arch; each fort and
 *                                      station sent loses a share of its men
 *                                      by the margin (CONFIG.BATTLE_LOSSES)
 *   Troops that survive come home after as many months as they had covered,
 *   and walk (or sail) back in to their fort or station; one whose fort or
 *   station is gone disbands. A lost city is in enemy hands for
 *   BATTLE_FOREIGN_MONTHS (after any troops are home), then retaken.
 *
 * Recall (Colonia's own; a fort's or station's panel, the Imperial advisor)
 *   While the battle is pending, the men (and ships) of one fort or station
 *   can be called back. Those still in the province on their way out (only
 *   in a save from before v0.18.3, when troops walked to the map's edge
 *   first) turn at once. Those already gone are reached by a rider, who rides at twice
 *   the marching pace: he needs riderMonths(covered) = half the months they
 *   have marched, rounded up, at least 1. They march on meanwhile (they do
 *   not know yet); when he reaches them they turn back and come home after
 *   as many months as they had marched out by then. Turned back, they no
 *   longer count in the battle (their strength comes off the army's). A
 *   rider who has not reached them when the battle is fought is too late:
 *   they fight with the rest, and come home by the battle's rule. An army
 *   everyone was called back from is "nobody sent" (-25 favor), so sending
 *   and recalling never costs less than staying home. Riders and the men
 *   coming home are military.recalls (they outlive the battle):
 *     { post, city, march, rider, riderTotal, homeIn, homeTotal, men, ships }
 *   rider > 0: the rider is out (his men are still in sent.men/ships);
 *   rider 0: turned back, their records in men/ships, home in homeIn months.
 *
 * No new men while deployed (sim/military.js, sim/navy.js)
 *   A fort or station with a rally point, or with men or ships away (on
 *   their way out, at the battle, or coming home), takes no recruits and no
 *   new liburnians: takesNewMen(). One already on his way still joins.
