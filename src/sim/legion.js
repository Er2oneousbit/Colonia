/**
 * legion.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Caesar's anger: the legions he sends against a governor whose favor
 * collapsed, and the loss of a city overrun by its enemies. The original's
 * rules, with its plain bugs left out (see the notes below).
 *
 * Favor 0 is not a defeat. Instead, checked daily (after the raids' day):
 *   - with no attack coming or on the map, favor at CONFIG.LEGION_FAVOR or
 *     less sets Caesar's legions marching: a message every time (the
 *     original announced only the first), and LEGION_MARCH_DAYS (12 months)
 *     later the army appears at the map entrance. The march cannot be called
 *     off: favor won back meanwhile only changes what the army does on arrival.
 *     Two reminders on the way (marchNotice), halfway (6 months) and a month
 *     away, say what the favor then would make it do (the original said
 *     nothing more after its first warning).
 *   - the army's size: CONFIG.LEGION_SIZES by the number of Caesar's attacks
 *     in this city so far (16, 32, 48, then 72), x the difficulty's raidSize,
 *     at most LEGION_MAX. Every man is an imperial legionary (data/units.js).
 *   - on the map, each day, favor decides (data/difficulty.js legionHalt and
 *     legionHome, the sane order: the original's was swapped):
 *       favor >= legionHome   the army marches home (for good)
 *       favor >= legionHalt   it halts where it stands, still fighting anyone
 *                             who attacks it, during its siege's first
 *                             LEGION_HALT_DAYS; after that it fights on
 *       below                 it attacks
 *   - targets: the governor's residence first, then the homes of the best
 *     level the city has (the nearest of them), then anything. The army
 *     walks a flow field seeded from its targets (sim/military.js fillField)
 *     in which other buildings can be broken through at a cost, so it goes
 *     round the city where it can and through it where it must.
 *   - the end: when no imperial legionary is left, the attack is over. Only
 *     an army destroyed in the field earns the governor Caesar's respect
 *     (+LEGION_RESPECT favor); one that marched home earns nothing (the
 *     original counted men who fled as killed, so a retreat paid the same).
 *     The next day, favor still at 10 or less starts the next, bigger attack.
 *
 * Raids go on as before beside it: a warband and the legions can be in the
 * province at once (sim/military.js keeps them apart: a legionary carries
 * `legion`, a raider `invasion`).
 *
 * Losing (checkOverrun, daily, in a game with goals): more invaders on the
 * map (Caesar's men, raiders ashore or still aboard their ships) than the
 * province's soldiers plus OVERRUN_MARGIN, while the population is under
 * OVERRUN_SHARE of its peak (city.stats.peakPopulation). The original's rule.
