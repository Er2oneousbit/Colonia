/**
 * fishing.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Shipyards, fishing wharves and their boats. Fish is a food of its own.
 *
 *   Fishing water: a river, the sea or a big lake (FISH_BODY_MIN tiles or
 *   more), with fishing grounds where gulls circle (world/map.js
 *   computeFishing: derived from the terrain, never saved). Shipyards and
 *   wharves stand on its bank with their front row out over the water,
 *   like a dock (sim/entities.js waterRowsFor), the slip or mooring just
 *   past it.
 *
 *   Shipyard: builds one fishing boat at a time from SHIPYARD_BOAT_TIMBER
 *   (100) timber: progress grows by staffing x 100 / SHIPYARD_BOAT_DAYS a day
 *   (x the difficulty's production), so a boat takes 16 days at full staff,
 *   but only while the yard holds the 100 timber; without it progress waits
 *   where it is. The timber is used when the boat is launched. Carts bring
 *   timber like a workshop's raw material (sim/storage.js rawRoomCap: a
 *   timber yard's carts, warehouses, dock wagons, nearest first) and the yard
 *   holds up to its inputCap (200, two boats). The boat is launched on the
 *   water beside the yard and waits there as the yard's spare: each day the
 *   yard sends it to the nearest staffed wharf on the same water (by water
 *   route) that has no boat. While its spare waits the yard builds nothing,
 *   so it keeps at most one boat in hand.
 *
 *   Wharf: its boat waits at the mooring (the water beside the wharf) for
 *   (1.02 - staffing) x BOAT_WAIT_DAYS days (0.2 at full staff, never with
 *   nobody at work, and not while the wharf holds WHARF_FULL fish), sails to
 *   the nearest fishing ground by water route, fishes FISH_DAYS (longer
 *   where the difficulty's production is lower), sails home and lands
 *   FISH_CATCH fish. Carts take the catch to a granary like a farm's
 *   harvest. Fishing goes on in every season: the sea does not freeze.
 *
 *   Boats are walkers (type 'fishing_boat', kind 'ship') that sail only on
 *   the water they were launched on, at walking pace, under bridges. A
 *   wharf's boat belongs to the wharf, a spare to its shipyard: when either
 *   building goes, its boat goes with it (sinks). Neptune's wrath sinks every
 *   boat (sinkFishingBoats); the yards build new ones.
 *
 * Unlike the original: a boat takes timber (the original's boats cost
 * nothing: Colonia's own rule, so a fishing fleet, and replacing one sunk by
 * Neptune or raiders, has a price in wood); the boat goes to the nearest
 * staffed wharf on its own water, not the first one built anywhere, staffed
 * or not; a yard never loses a finished boat (the original threw a boat
 * away when no water tile beside the yard was open on all sides); the
 * nearest ground is the nearest by water, not as the crow flies; a boat that
 * cannot get home vanishes with a message (at most one a month) instead of
 * being stranded; and the boat waits for the catch to be carted only when
 * two catches are waiting.
