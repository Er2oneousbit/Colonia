/**
 * tradeDemand.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What each trade partner buys in a mission, and how often its traders come.
 * Pure: it reads the scenario and the date, never game state, so nothing here
 * is saved (a save made before a demand change loads and gets it on time).
 * The one exception is a route's pace (routeInterval), which counts only the
 * goods the player trades with that partner (sim/tradeSwitches.js).
 *
 * Demand in force (the original's quota tiers, in Colonia's units)
 *   A partner's yearly purchase of a good starts from its own table
 *   (TRADE_PARTNERS `buys`). A mission may set some of them for itself
 *   (scenario `demand: { partner: { good: units } }`), on the original's
 *   tiers of 15, 25 and 40 loads a year: DEMAND_TIERS. A mission may also
 *   schedule demand changes (scenario `demandChanges: [{ year, partner,
 *   good, to }]`): in the mission's year `year` (1 = its first), in a month
 *   from Martius to October drawn from the map's seed on a stream of its own
 *   (as distant battles draw theirs, sim/battle.js), the partner's yearly
 *   amount of that good becomes `to`; 0 stops it. Every change is worked out
 *   from the scenario and the date, so a change never needs saving.
 *
 * Busy routes come more often (Colonia's form of the original's rule that a
 *   route of large quotas keeps up to three traders in the province)
 *   A caravan carries CARAVAN_MAX_TRADE each way and comes every 32 to 56
 *   days, about 3,500 units a year; a ship carries SHIP_MAX_TRADE every 64
 *   to 96 days, about 5,800. A route whose larger direction (what it buys, or
 *   what it sells, counting only the goods switched on with it) is more than
 *   that comes proportionally more often: its
 *   interval is scaled by carry / volume, so on average its traders can carry
 *   its whole year (a Pharus's or Mansio Magna's quarter more, tradeBoost,
 *   counts too: its partners' traders come more often). The line sits at the full carry, not below it, so every
 *   route of the first two missions, the military provinces of steps 3 to 5,
 *   Paestum, Oasis Aurea and Urbs Magna keeps its pace (the busiest, Aquileia's
 *   caravans at 3,200 and Corinthus's ships at 5,200, are at 92% and 90% of
 *   it).
 *
 * Far routes (Colonia's own rule: in the original a partner's place on the
 *   empire map changed nothing about trade)
 *   A trader needs tripDays days to come from its city and as many to go
 *   back (data/empireRoutes.js: half a day per map unit of its route). A
 *   quiet route's traders cannot come more often than one round trip, so
 *   the usual range [a, b] becomes [max(a, 2 x trip), that + (b - a)]. The
 *   busy rule then scales that range, so a far busy route keeps several
 *   traders on the road at once and still carries its whole year. Every
 *   round trip from the Etruscan coast (Alexandria's is the longest, 58
 *   days against the ships' 64) fits in the usual range: there, and for
 *   every near partner anywhere, nothing changes. The capacity model
 *   (sim/capacity.js) counts ships without distance (visitsPerYear): a far
 *   route sends fewer ships, but each stays longer for its bigger loads.
