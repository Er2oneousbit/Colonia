/**
 * construction.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything the player can build or clear goes through here.
 *
 * Two-step API used by the UI (preview while dragging, apply on release):
 *   const plan = planAction(game, tool, x0, y0, x1, y1)
 *   applyPlan(game, plan)
 *
 * `tool` is a building key ('house', 'prefecture', ...) or a tile tool
 * ('road', 'aqueduct', 'plaza', 'bridge', 'low_bridge', 'wall', 'roadblock', 'clear').
 *
 * Roadblocks: placed on a road tile (map.roadblock), they turn back roaming
 * walkers (see sim/movement.js). Clearing a roadblock leaves its road.
 *
 * Walls: dragged like roads over open land. Where a wall crosses a road it
 * becomes a gate (citizens pass, raiders must break it). Dragging a road
 * through an existing wall turns that wall tile into a gate as well.
 *
 * A plan lists every tile/building it would touch with ok/reason flags and a
 * total cost, so the renderer can color the preview green/red and the UI can
 * show "Cost: 120 Dn". Nothing changes until applyPlan().
 *
 * The last construction can be undone (Ctrl+Z) for a few days, with a full
 * refund, as long as nothing has moved into it yet.
