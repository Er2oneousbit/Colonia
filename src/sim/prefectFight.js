/**
 * prefectFight.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Prefects against raiders and Caesar's legionaries, and against any other
 * unit hostile to Rome (sim/combat.js hostileToRome: a wolf, a villager of
 * a native village at war), which a prefect fights the same way.
 *
 * A prefect on his rounds (walking his patrol or heading home: not running to
 * a fire, putting one out or chasing a criminal) who has an enemy on land
 * within CONFIG.PREFECT_FIGHT_REACH tiles stops and fights him, as the
 * original's prefects did. He stands on his road tile (sim/walkers.js: a
 * held walker does not move) and strikes with CONFIG.PREFECT_COMBAT, a third
 * of a legionary's attack, while the enemy is within reach. An enemy who goes
 * farther than CONFIG.PREFECT_FIGHT_LEASH ends the fight and the prefect goes
 * on with his rounds: he never chases one across the map. Fires come first:
 * a prefect sent to a fire (sim/risk.js dispatchPrefect) drops the fight.
 * Raiders still aboard their ships are out of reach (only land units count),
 * and so is an enemy across water, a wall or a building (clearBetween). He
 * leaves alone an enemy who is not out to fight (fightable): a fleeing
 * warband, and Caesar's men while they wait their turn at the entrance,
 * march home, or stand halted.
 *
 * The enemy he fights turns on him (fightPrefect, called from the raider's
 * and the legionary's own update): only once no soldier is near, as a raider
 * prefers soldiers, and he goes back to the buildings once the prefect is
 * dead, gone, or out of his way. A prefect can be killed: the walker is
 * removed, the military stats count him, and his prefecture sends the next
 * one only after its usual spawn delay, so the streets go unwatched for a
 * while. A message comes only when several fall close together.
 *
 * An enemy a prefect kills counts toward the raid's (or the legion's) slain
 * like any other (sim/units.js removeUnit), so the same rules repel it.
 *
 * State, all saved with the walker or unit (core/save.js copies every field):
 *   prefect  fight    id of the enemy unit he fights (0: none)
 *            hp       his health, set at his first fight (he does not heal)
 *            fightCd  ticks until his next blow
 *            hitTick  last tick he was hurt
 *   enemy    foe      id of the prefect he fights back (0: none)
 *            foeIgnore { prefect id: tick } prefects he could not get at,
 *                      left alone (and leaving him alone) until that tick
