/**
 * pace.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How fast a mission's goals can be met, worked out from the game's own rate
 * limits. It sets the length of the campaign's missions: the tests hold each
 * mission to its planned pace, and `npm run sim -- --pace` prints the table.
 *
 * The model is a floor, the pace of a city that is always ready: a home
 * waiting for every settler, a good mood (PACE_MOOD) from the first day, and
 * every rating already deserved, so each one only waits on its monthly step.
 * Real play is slower (the homes, farms and services have to be built first),
 * but the floor is what the goals decide.
 *
 *   population  settlers arrive at immigrationPerDay(mood), more in a new
 *               city's first months (sim/population.js)
 *   culture     rises at most CULTURE_STEP a month
 *   prosperity  rises at most PROSPERITY_STEP a month
 *   peace       rises PEACE_PER_MONTH a month from PEACE_START
 *   favor       requests met and gifts from the governor's savings buy it:
 *               it takes those, not time
