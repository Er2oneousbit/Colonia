/**
 * capacity.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How many people a mission's buildings can employ: the yardstick for its
 * population goal. Beside sim/pace.js (how fast goals can be met), this says
 * how big a goal can be at all. A test holds the campaign's population goals
 * under it, and `npm run sim -- --capacity` prints the table.
 *
 * Why it matters: WORKFORCE_RATIO of the plebeian residents look for work, and
 * above UNEMPLOYMENT_MOOD_FREE unemployment the city's mood falls (up to 15
 * points, sim/population.js), so peace stops growing (it needs PEACE_MOOD). A
 * goal of more people than the mission's buildings can employ cannot be met by
 * a well run city: mission 1 asked for 1,200 people when a sensible town of
 * Huts has about 100 jobs, and stalled near 600 to 720 with half its workers
 * idle.
 *
 * The model is a yardstick, not a simulation. For a city of P people, in the
 * best working homes the mission allows and, where its homes can reach the
 * Villa, a villa quarter, it lists the buildings a player puts up (planCity)
 * and counts their workers; the employment ceiling is the largest P whose
 * jobs keep the plebeians' unemployment at or below UNEMPLOYMENT_MOOD_FREE.
 * Two profiles say how generously the player builds:
 *
 *   LEAN       a building for each trip's worth of homes: a walker covers 4
 *              home tiles for each tile of its roam, farms grow just what the
 *              city eats. Few buildings, though not a strict floor: a walker
 *              starts each trip in a new direction and serves on the way home,
 *              so over the months a visit lasts one building can reach more.
 *   SENSIBLE   a careful player's town: 2 home tiles per tile of roam (in a
 *              street, house, house grid each home lies beside a street, so a
 *              street tile has 2 homes of its own; a chosen figure, not a
 *              count: the demo city builds denser, about 1.2) and 3 farms more
 *              than the town needs (the demo city builds 4 where a mission 1
 *              town of 300 needs 1: fields only partly on meadow, a harvest
 *              Ceres may blight, granaries to fill). Checked by play, not
 *              derived: in mission 1, `npm run sim -- --scenario c1 --unlocks
 *              --homes 40` had 312 people, 95 to 100 jobs and 4% out of work
 *              (348 people on 44 plots: 14%), and the profile gives 300; in
 *              mission 2 the demo city's whole site (`--level 3`) held 450 to
 *              481 people at 4%, and the profile gives 450. The ceilings of
 *              big cities lean on the 2: at 1.2 the late missions' would be
 *              far higher. The campaign's goals are held to this profile.
 *
 * Both profiles share the rest:
 *
 *   homes      the working level: the best level the unlocks allow whose
 *              residents work. Where the homes can reach the Villa, a villa
 *              quarter too: PATRICIAN_SHARE of the people in Villas (the
 *              cheapest patrician home, so the fewest jobs per person). The
 *              villas' people need every service, food and five goods but add
 *              no workers, as patricians in the original; the late missions'
 *              prosperity goals all but require them (the rating counts
 *              patricians up to 15% of the city). The share was checked in
 *              play with the demo city's villa quarter (see PATRICIAN_SHARE)
 *   quarters   walkers serve every home they pass, villa or not: each walker
 *              service, fountain, hospital and show is planned over the tiles
 *              of every home whose level needs it, both quarters together (a
 *              Villa needs what an Insula does and a second god, whose priests
 *              are added for the villas' tiles). Play showed villas growing
 *              among the working homes, served by the same walkers, so the
 *              villa quarter brings no services of its own (planning them per
 *              quarter, with at least one of each, made the ceilings jump by
 *              a whole set of services even for a few villas). Food, granaries,
 *              industry, warehouses, exports, docks, the army, the Senate and
 *              the hippodrome are planned once for the whole city; the villas
 *              add their food and five goods, wine among them
 *   services   one building per stretch of homes its walker covers (above).
 *              Fountains and hospitals cover their radius, of which HOME_SHARE
 *              is homes. Upkeep (prefects, engineers) covers homes, plus one of
 *              each for the farms and one for any industry; gardeners' yards
 *              cover the homes that need gardens and statues (DECOR_DOWN)
 *   food       farms on full meadow at the most productive difficulty: homes
 *              eat their level's kinds of food in equal shares (sim/housing.js
 *              consumeHouse), so the fastest kinds are each grown on their own
 *              farms at their own rate, at least one farm a kind, plus the
 *              profile's spareFarms on the fastest; granaries hold
 *              GRANARY_MONTHS of food
 *   gods       every unlocked god gets temples for its share of the city
 *              (PEOPLE_PER_TEMPLE, sim/religion.js), at least one; the gods the
 *              level needs also send priests past every home
 *   shows      the cheapest set of venues (and the troupes and schools that
 *              keep them booked) that reaches the level's entertainment
 *   industry   only as far as there is a buyer: the homes' own use of the
 *              goods their level needs, plus each trade partner's yearly
 *              purchases of what the city can make, as in force when the
 *              mission's goals can first be met (its paceYears: a rise the
 *              mission schedules after that does not count; sim/tradeDemand.js).
 *              Raw materials come from the city's own producers when the
 *              mission unlocks them (else they are bought, which employs nobody
 *              here). Warehouses hold WAREHOUSE_MONTHS of that flow
 *   docks      enough Emporia for the sea partners' ships: each route's ships
 *              a year (more on a busy route) staying SHIP_STAY_DAYS
 *   hippodrome where it is unlocked with its chariot stable: one of each (a
 *              city has one), as a late city builds for its palaces' shows
 *   marble     a home good from the Marble Villa up, above both quarters'
 *              levels, so no quarry is planned for the homes (one would be,
 *              at marble's half rate, if a quarter ever needed it); a top
 *              level needs it in the province (levelReachable: a quarry or
 *              a partner). The marble the grand buildings are made of is a
 *              one-off, like the army's equipment, and adds no lasting jobs
 *   army       a mission with raids: a barracks, one fort of each unlocked
 *              kind and two towers (their equipment is a one-off batch, so
 *              it adds no lasting workshop jobs)
 *   rule       buildings come whole: a third of a farm's harvest still takes
 *              a whole farm and its workers
 *
 * The land ceiling asks whether the map has room: homes and their streets on
 * LAND_FOR_HOMES of the buildable land, and food from farms on MEADOW_FARMED
 * of the meadow at the least productive difficulty (Insane, whose fields rest
 * in winter).
