 * (home-days without the service, for homes within reach of one).
 * Tax collectors: a registration lasts half as long as any other visit; the
 * mission 4 save's homes went 48,453 home-days unregistered without the
 * overlap and 14,218 with it, the demo city's 8,867 and 2,916, mission 2's
 * 2,156 and none. Priests, barbers, physicians and bath attendants: one
 * temple, barber, clinic or bath serves a wide area; the demo city's homes
 * went 10,041 home-days without Venus and 1,729 without a barber (1,833 and
 * none with it), the mission 4 save's 4,481 without baths and 2,169 without
 * a physician (720 and 960). Not teachers, librarians or scholars, whose
 * homes were seldom without them already (the demo city's longest wait for
 * a school 109 days), nor entertainers, who roam only while shows play and
 * gained nothing clear (the mission 4 save's theater homes 4,401 home-days
 * without, 8,978 with; its amphitheater's 5,736 and 2,249) for 60% more of
 * them in the streets, nor market vendors: a market already keeps two out,
 * the overlap made it three, and the mission 4 save's homes went 6,553
 * home-days without one before and 7,379 after.
 * Gardeners too, upkeep like the engineers: a garden or statue starts to
 * fade a month (16 days) after a visit, sooner than a gardener's round out
 * (15 days for his 30 tiles) and home again takes, so a yard that waited for
 * him to walk back would leave its streets to fade between rounds.
