/**
 * fame.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Hall of Fame: a score for each campaign win, the ten best wins and the
 * career's score. Not in Caesar III (its end screen showed the ratings, the
 * people and the treasury, and kept no list); Colonia's own design, with a
 * mission's goals and its planned pace (sim/pace.js, `paceYears`) as a fair
 * yardstick for every mission.
 *
 * Score of one win (winScore):
 *   R = the four ratings at the win, added (0 to 400)
 *   P = 100 x population / the population goal, at most 200 (whole points)
 *   S = 100 x paceYears / years taken, at most 150 (100 when as fast as the
 *       plan allows; whole points)
 *   D = the difficulty: Easy 0.5, Normal 1, Hard 1.5, Insane 2
 *   score = round(D x (R + P + S)) + 50 for each distant battle won and 25
 *   for each raid repelled in that mission, and 150 for a finished monument
 *   standing at the win (data/monuments.js FAME_MONUMENT; shown as lines of
 *   their own). A monument is never a goal: it is rewarded here instead.
 *   Worked example: Firmum on Normal, ratings 45 + 30 + 50 + 40 = 165; 1,800
 *   people for a goal of 1,600: P 112; won in 6 years where the plan says
 *   4.5: S 75; one battle won and two raids repelled: 352 + 50 + 50 = 452.
 *
 * The career: the best win at each step of the campaign, added, plus 500
 * once a province of the last step is won (Rome hails the governor Caesar).
 * Missions can be replayed: each keeps its best win, and a replay that
 * scores lower changes nothing. The ten best wins list each mission once,
 * with its best.
 *
 * What is kept lives in the browser beside the campaign's progress (app.js,
 * `${STORAGE_PREFIX}fame`), never in a game save, and the sim never reads
 * it. The sandbox is not scored: its goals are the player's own.
