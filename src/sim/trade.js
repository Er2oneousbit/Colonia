/**
 * trade.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Trade with other cities, overland and by sea.
 *
 *   - The player opens a route (one-time cost) in the Trade advisor.
 *   - Land routes: every 1-2 months a caravan walks in along the Imperial road
 *     to the nearest staffed warehouse, sells the city its imports, buys its
 *     exports, then leaves by the exit. A partner whose round trip on the
 *     empire map is longer than that sends them less often, and a route
 *     busier than its traders can carry at that pace more often
 *     (sim/tradeDemand.js).
 *   - Sea routes: a merchant ship sails in from the map edge (map.seaEntry)
 *     to a free, staffed Dock and moors there while goods move both ways:
 *       - on mooring it fixes its manifest: what it will sell (imports) and
 *         what it wants to buy (exports), with the same rules as a caravan;
 *       - the dock's crane lands its imports on the quay, DOCK_LOAD every
 *         DOCK_UNLOAD_DAYS, and the city pays as each lot lands;
 *       - the dock's workers (1 to 3, by staffing) cart quay goods to where
 *         any cart would take them, and fetch exports, DOCK_LOAD a trip, from
 *         staffed warehouses within DOCK_REACH road tiles; the city is paid
 *         when a lot is handed over to the ship;
 *       - the ship casts off when both sides are done, after
 *         SHIP_MAX_STAY_DAYS, or when its Dock is lost.
 *     Ships need navigable water: a river, the coast or a big lake that
 *     reaches the map edge.
 *   - Per good, the player chooses: none / import / export, plus a stock level:
 *       export: sell only while city stock is ABOVE the level
 *       import: buy only while city stock is BELOW the level
 *     and per partner, on its route card, a switch for each good it deals
 *     in (sim/tradeSwitches.js): a good trades with a partner only while
 *     its setting allows it and that partner's switch is on. A partner with
 *     every switch off sends no traders.
 *   - Each partner buys/sells at most a fixed amount per good per year. What
 *     it buys may be set by the mission and change during it (demand in
 *     force, sim/tradeDemand.js); tradeMonthly tells the player when.
 *   - Horses are kept at the Horse Ranch, never in a warehouse (data/goods.js
 *     keptAt), so for horses the ranches stand in for the warehouses: a
 *     caravan sells into and buys from the ranches on its warehouse's roads,
 *     dock workers fetch exports from staffed ranches within DOCK_REACH and
 *     cart imports to a barracks that needs them or a ranch with room. With
 *     no ranch, no horses are imported (importBlockedText says so).
 *   - Prices are each partner's own this year (sim/prices.js tradePrice: the
 *     base price, the province's market, the year's drift and the route's
 *     length), paid as goods change hands: a caravan's at the warehouse, a
 *     ship's as each lot lands and as each goes aboard.
