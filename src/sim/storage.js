/**
 * storage.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Granaries and warehouses: capacity math, adding/taking goods, and finding
 * where a cart should deliver its load.
 *
 * Delivery priority for a cart carrying good G:
 *   1. a barracks that needs G to equip recruits (weapons, arrows, horses),
 *      or a navalia that needs G for the fleet's next ship (timber, iron, linen)
 *   2. a workshop whose recipe uses G and has room (raw materials go straight in),
 *      or a shipyard (timber for its boats: rawRoomCap), nearest first
 *   3. a granary that accepts G (food only)
 *   4. a warehouse that accepts G
 * "Room" includes loads already on their way (reservations in b.incoming),
 * so two carts never race to fill the same last slot.
 *
 * Horses are different (data/goods.js keptAt): they live in a Horse Ranch's
 * stables, never in a warehouse. A cart (a dock worker's, with imports) takes
 * them to a barracks that needs them, else to a ranch with room
 * (STABLE_CAPACITY). A ranch's own grooms go only to a barracks: one ranch
 * never passes horses to another. The ranches count as city storage for
 * horses (cityStock, takeFromCity: trade levels, the Emperor, the advisors).
 *
 * Storage orders (the player's, per building; sim/storageOrders.js runs the
 * carts they send): each good is 'accept', 'refuse' or 'get', and the
 * building has an Empty switch. Refuse and Empty only stop deliveries IN
 * (producer, dock and storage carts, caravan imports). Nobody taking goods
 * OUT looks at them: market buyers, exports, the Emperor and other storage's
 * Get carts. Get counts as accepting.
