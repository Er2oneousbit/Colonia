 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Training buildings (Actor Troupe, Gladiator School, Menagerie) send
 * performers to venues. A venue with booked shows sends an Entertainer walker
 * around the neighborhood; homes it passes gain entertainment points.
 *
 *   theater       accepts actors
 *   amphitheater  accepts gladiators (or actors)
 *   colosseum     accepts gladiators and beasts
 *   hippodrome    accepts charioteers (a Factio's teams): races
 *
 * Every home also gets a city-wide base (0..ENT_BASE_MAX) for how well the
 * seats of working venues cover the population, averaged over the three
 * seat kinds: a big city needs more venues, not just one of each. A working
 * hippodrome seats the whole city (see VENUE_SEATS in data/buildings.js),
 * and a staffed Great Arena adds a flat ARENA_ENT_BONUS on top.
