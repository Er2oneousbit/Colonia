 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The gods' moods (0-100), updated monthly.
 *
 * Each god expects enough temples for its share of the population
 * (PEOPLE_PER_TEMPLE per temple; a large temple counts as two, as the
 * original counted 1,500 people of coverage to a small temple's 750). Homes
 * still count distinct gods, whatever the size of the temple whose priest
 * passed. Festivals and oracles lift every mood.
 * Very happy gods bless the city; angry gods punish it.
 *
 * Festivals cost money, food from the granaries and, large or grand, wine
 * from the warehouses, all or nothing, and are held at the god's temples,
 * whose priests a bigger feast needs more of: a staffed temple has one, a
 * large temple two; a small festival needs 1, a large one 3, a grand one 3
 * and an Oracle (Colonia's own rule; festivalTempleBlocked). A god whose last festival is more
 * than a year past is neglected: its mood target falls a point a month, 28
 * at most (the original's rule; not in towns under 800 people). A
 * city-wide cooldown (2, 4 or 8 months) still spaces them, short enough
 * for small festivals in turn to keep all five gods inside their year; one
 * held within 3 months of the last lifts the people's mood less, so the
 * turns do not lift the city mood above what festivals did before.
 *
 * Two levels of wrath (the original's minor and major curse): a god that
 * strikes is "angered" until its mood climbs back above GOD_CALM_MOOD. If it
 * strikes again before then, Mercury and Venus strike harder, except in a
 * mission whose scenario says majorWrath: false (the first two), where the
 * second wrath is like the first. Ceres, Neptune and Mars strike the same
 * way every time.
 *
 * The five gods (data/gods.js):
 *   Ceres    blessing: every farm ripens.  wrath: farm progress lost.
 *   Neptune  blessing: money.  wrath: buildings near water weakened, and
 *            every fishing boat sinks (the original's curse; the shipyards
 *            build new ones); where the city trades by sea, merchant ships
 *            under sail sink too and none sails for 80 days (sim/events.js).
 *   Mercury  blessing: the emptiest working granary gets MERCURY_BLESS_FOOD of
 *            each land food (no fish).  wrath: the fullest granary or warehouse loses
 *            MERCURY_WRATH_LOSS units; again before he calms, it burns.
 *   Mars     blessing: +10 peace.  wrath: -10 peace, treasury looted.
 *   Venus    blessing: every home's mood +VENUS_BLESS_HOME and a city mood
 *            factor that decays (city.venusBoost, sim/population.js).
 *            wrath: home moods capped and lowered, a negative factor; again
 *            before she calms, harder, and badly served homes gain disease
 *            risk where disease is active.
