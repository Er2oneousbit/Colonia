/**
 * production.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Farms, raw material producers and workshops, plus warehouses shipping raw
 * materials to workshops.
 *
 *   Farm/raw producer: progress grows daily with staffing (and fertility for
 *   farms). At 100 a batch of CART_CAPACITY units is ready and a cart pusher
 *   carries it to a workshop, granary or warehouse (see storage.js).
 *
 *   Workshop: uses one batch of its recipe (usually 100 units of one raw
 *   material; the Fletcher needs timber AND iron) to make one batch of goods.
 *   Workshops receive raw material from producers directly, or from
 *   warehouses that notice a workshop running low.
 *
 *   Horse Ranch: a farm whose output also scales with its breeding herd
 *   (2 mares at first, up to 8 as the ranch matures). Its horses stay in its
 *   stables (STABLE_CAPACITY, 8 horses; a full ranch foals no more) until a
 *   Tirocinium needs them for cavalry: then a groom leads them straight
 *   there (shipHorses). They never go to a warehouse.
 *
 *   Winter (December to Februarius) multiplies farm growth by the
 *   difficulty's `winterGrowth`: 0 on Insane, so every farm (crops, pigs,
 *   the ranch's foals and herd) keeps its progress but adds none until
 *   Martius. Workers stay on (and are paid) and carts still haul the harvest
 *   already in store. farmSeasonNotice() tells the player.
 *
 *   Warehouses also forward weapons and arrows to barracks when the forts
 *   need recruits, and timber, iron and linen to a navalia while a naval
 *   station has an empty berth (sim/navy.js). Horses an older save left in a
 *   warehouse go the same way, or to a ranch with room.
