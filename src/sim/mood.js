/**
 * mood.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Home mood: how content each household is, for crime only. City mood
 * (computeSentiment in sim/population.js) keeps driving migration exactly as
 * before and never reads these.
 *
 * Twice a month (day 0, right after the month's city mood, and day 8) every
 * occupied home works out a target:
 *
 *   target = city mood + hunger + food variety + envy + desirability + untaxed
 *            (clamped 0-100)
 *
 *   hunger       a home whose level eats and has no food at all (it went
 *                without at its last meal and the pantry is still empty):
 *                -MOOD_HUNGER x its hunger streak (updates in a row like that,
 *                at most MOOD_HUNGER_STREAK); any food resets it. Tents forage.
 *   variety      +MOOD_FOOD_EXTRA per kind of food beyond its level's need
 *   envy         the poorest homes (up to MOOD_ENVY_TIER) in a city with villas,
 *                or with insulae: being poor among the rich hurts most
 *   desirability its street's desirability / MOOD_DES_DIV, +-MOOD_DES_MAX
 *   untaxed      +MOOD_UNTAXED while no tax collector has registered it
 *
 * The home's mood then moves toward the target by at most MOOD_STEP. (A pure
 * running total, as in the original game, walks every home to 0 or 100 on
 * any small imbalance; the target keeps homes near what their street
 * deserves.) A newly occupied home starts at the city's mood; an empty one
 * has none (null) and never breeds crime.
 *
 * Each home also records its reason: its own most negative term, else the
 * city's worst mood factor, for the house panel and the crime overlay.
