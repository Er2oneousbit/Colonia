/**
 * labor.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Daily workforce allocation.
 *
 * Workforce = WORKFORCE_RATIO of all plebeian residents (patricians do not work).
 * A building can hire only if it has road access AND labor access (a walker
 * from it recently passed occupied housing).
 *
 * When there are fewer workers than jobs:
 *   1. categories the player marked as priorities are filled first, in order
 *   2. everything else shares the remainder proportionally
 * Inside a category every building gets the same share.
 * Efficiency (workers / needed) scales production and walker spawn speed.
