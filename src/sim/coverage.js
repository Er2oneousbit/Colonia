/**
 * coverage.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The numbers behind the Health, Education and Entertainment advisors, read
 * from the city as the sim leaves it, and the one piece of advice each gives.
 * Read-only: nothing here changes the game (the original's Entertainment
 * advisor recomputed city values whenever it was opened; Colonia's must not).
 *
 * Coverage follows Colonia's own rules, not the original's places per
 * building:
 *   - Health and education reach homes by walker visits (sim/services.js),
 *     and a hospital by its area (HOSPITAL_RADIUS), with no limit on how many
 *     homes one building serves. So a service's coverage is the people it
 *     serves out of the people who need it: the residents of homes whose
 *     next level (their own, at the top) asks for it, and of those, the ones
 *     whose home has it. Its reach is everyone it visited, needed or not:
 *     what the culture rating and the health score count.
 *   - Entertainment has seats (data/buildings.js VENUE_SEATS: theater 400,
 *     amphitheater 900, colosseum 2,000; the original's were 500, 800 and
 *     1,500): a venue kind's coverage is the seats of its working venues
 *     (staffed, shows booked) as a share of the population, the rule behind
 *     the city-wide base (sim/entertainment.js seatCoverage).
 * Percentages are truncated, so 100 means everyone.
 *
 * The advice is the original's idea in Colonia's terms: the need that holds
 * the most homes back from their next level, each home counted once per need
 * (the original counted a home ready to move up twice, and never counted the
 * demand for academies). Needs no building of the province can meet come
 * last: the Problems overlay leaves such homes alone, and so does the advice.
