/**
 * training.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Military Academy (the original's) and the Portus (Colonia's own, the
 * fleet's counterpart, after the harbor Agrippa cut near Naples to train his
 * crews): who goes to be trained, and when.
 *
 * Training belongs to the man, or the ship's crew: every Roman unit has a
 * `trained` flag, set when he has trained his time at a fully staffed academy
 * (or the ship at the Portus), not as he sets out or arrives. The original trained a whole legion the moment one recruit
 * set out for the academy, even if he died on the way; Colonia's soldiers are
 * individuals, so the fort panel shows "5 of 8 trained" instead.
 *
 * Only a building at full staff trains anybody (every worker in place, a road,
 * and for a Portus its water), as in the original: 19 of 20 trains no one.
 * "Nearest" is the larger of the two axis distances between the buildings'
 * centers (the original's measure), the lower id on a tie.
 *
 * Who goes
 *   A new recruit: the barracks picks his fort as before. If a training
 *   academy stands anywhere, the one nearest HIS FORT (not the barracks: a
 *   recruit may cross the city and back, as in the original) is his first
 *   stop, as long as the roads join barracks, academy and fort. He walks to
 *   its road and stays there ACADEMY_TRAIN_DAYS (walker state 'training'),
 *   his place in the fort held for him; the days count only while the
 *   academy is fully staffed (one short of staff pauses him). Then, trained,
 *   he walks on to his fort; the academy demolished meanwhile, he walks on
 *   untrained.
 *
 *   A soldier at rest (Colonia's own: in the original a man who joined
 *   untrained stayed so, and a playtester's full fort of untrained men never
 *   went to the academy built after them): once a day (startTrips), a fort
 *   at rest sends its untrained man resting in the yard with the lowest slot
 *   to the academy nearest it, when the roads join the two and he can find
 *   a way there on foot (its length sets the trip's time limit). At rest means not
 *   deployed, none of its men away at a distant battle, nothing that would
 *   have its men stand to (raiders, Caesar's men or a revolt in the province,
 *   raider ships off the shore, a wolf or angry villager near the fort,
 *   sim/military.js standsTo), and no warband a month away (the last
 *   warning). TRIPS_AT_ONCE go at a time, a man still walking back counting
 *   as away, and never the last man in the yard, so a fort is never emptied.
 *   He leaves by the gate, marches over open land like any soldier to the
 *   academy's road, trains ACADEMY_TRAIN_DAYS there by a recruit's rules
 *   (trainAt: the days count only at full staff, TRAIN_WAIT_MAX_DAYS at
 *   most) and marches back into the yard, trained; his place in the fort is
 *   his all along (he is still its unit: `drill` is the academy's id). The
 *   academy demolished or cut off from the roads meanwhile, he comes home
 *   untrained.
 *
 *   Called back: the moment his fort is deployed or its men would stand to
 *   (sim/military.js updateRoman, every tick), he turns for home, untrained
 *   if he had not finished, and fights on the way as any man marching home
 *   does (whoever strikes at him). Sent to a distant battle with his fort,
 *   he goes with the rest (sim/battle.js sendTroops), untrained. No new trip
 *   starts until the fort is at rest again. A trip that has not reached the
 *   academy in time (DRILL_MAX_DAYS, or twice the walk for a far one, see
 *   startDrill) is given up, and the fort sends nobody for TRIP_RETRY_DAYS.
 *
 *   A new liburnian: launched at the Navalia for its station (sim/navy.js), it
 *   rows first to the berth of the training Portus nearest that station on the
 *   same water, moors there PORTUS_TRAIN_DAYS (counted, as at the academy,
 *   only while the Portus is fully staffed; `trainLeft`), then rows on to its
 *   own berth, trained. Ships at their berths take turns as soldiers at rest
 *   do: a station at rest sends its untrained berthed ship with the lowest
 *   slot to that Portus, TRIPS_AT_ONCE at a time, never the last at its
 *   berths.
 *
 *   A raid, or the station being deployed, calls a ship on its way to the
 *   Portus (or moored there, training) straight to its station, untrained (it
 *   is needed), and a ship launched then does not go. A trip that does not
 *   reach the Portus in time (DRILL_MAX_DAYS, or twice the row for a far
 *   Portus, see startDrill) is given up.
 *
 * What training gives (Colonia has no morale, so the original's effects
 * become stats, data/units.js): trained legionaries holding position take a
 * share of missile damage and defend better (the original's close order),
 * trained archers and cavalry defend a little better (sim/military.js
 * unitDefense, missileDamage); a trained crew rows faster, rams harder and is
 * harder to hit (sim/navy.js). Attack and hit points never change. For a
 * distant battle, battleStrength gives what each counts for.
