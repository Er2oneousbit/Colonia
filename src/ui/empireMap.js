/**
 * empireMap.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The empire map: the Mediterranean world with your province, Rome, every
 * trade partner of the scenario, and who is on the way. One renderer serves
 * both the small map at the top of the Trade advisor and the full Empire
 * screen (ui/empire.js).
 *
 *   land route  brown line along the roads (caravans on the road)
 *   sea route   blue line along the sea lanes (merchant ships)
 *   open routes are drawn solid and bold, closed ones faint and broken
 *   travelers   a caravan or ship in the partner's color, partway along its
 *               route; a warband as a banner, at the frontier with no number
 *               while only rumoured, then from its side with its size (in a
 *               boat when it comes by sea, sim/navy.js, out on the sea)
 *   armies      Caesar's legions as a purple standard on the road from Rome;
 *               a city Caesar asked troops for (a small walled square), the
 *               enemy's line of march to it with its banner, and the
 *               province's troops (a red standard) on their way there or home
 *
 * Travelers are drawn from timers the sim already keeps, never simulated:
 * a route's `nextVisit` day (sim/trade.js), the raid schedule
 * `nextRaidMonth` with its `warnStage` and the scouts' `warned` report
 * (sim/military.js), the legions' countdown (sim/legion.js) and the battle's
 * months (sim/battle.js).
 * Nothing here changes game state, so the map is safe to draw paused or not.
 *
 * All shapes are drawn in a 100 x 60 "map unit" space and scaled to the
 * canvas. The coasts, rivers, mountains and route lanes are real geography
 * written down in data/empireGeo.js (drawn for this game, not traced).
