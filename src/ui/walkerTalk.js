/**
 * walkerTalk.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Who a walker is, what it is doing and what it has to say, for the info
 * panel when a walker is clicked. Citizens talk about what troubles the city
 * most (Caesar's legions, raiders, hunger, fires, sickness, troops away at a
 * distant battle, no work, taxes, an angry god), or about
 * their work when nothing does; newcomers, emigrants, foreign traders and
 * the city's criminals (protesters say what upsets their home) have lines of
 * their own. Every line is written for Colonia.
 *
 * Read-only: nothing here changes the simulation. A walker keeps the same
 * line for a few days (the pick is seeded by its id and the date), so the
 * panel does not flicker between lines as it refreshes.
