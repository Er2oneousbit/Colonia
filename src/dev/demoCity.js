/**
 * demoCity.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Builds a sample city on any generated map using ONLY the public
 * construction API (the same one the player uses). Used by:
 *   - the headless balance simulation (scripts/simulate.mjs)
 *   - automated screenshot tests
 *   - the debug console command `demo`
 *
 * Layout: find a mostly-free rectangle beside the Imperial road and fill it
 * with streets every third row (street, house, house), two cross streets
 * joining them to the Imperial road, and service buildings dropped into the
 * housing bands. Farms and a granary go on the best meadow nearby.
 *
 * In a campaign mission it builds only what the mission unlocks (a locked
 * building is skipped, not tried slot after slot), unless the game was made
 * with the unlockall flag; in a sandbox everything is unlocked, so a sandbox
 * city is the same either way.
