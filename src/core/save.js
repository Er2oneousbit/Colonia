/**
 * save.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Save / load.
 *
 * Format (JSON):
 *   {
 *     format: 'colonia-save', version: SAVE_VERSION,
 *     meta:   { city, scenarioId, date, population, treasury, difficulty, savedAt },
 *     scenario (sandbox: in full; campaign: { id }), flags, difficulty,
 *     rng, time, seed, map (base64 layers), buildings[], walkers[], fires[],
 *     ruins[], units[], military, wildlife, wallHp[], city, messages[], nextIds, camera
 *   }
 *
 * Raiders' peoples and wolves (data/peoples.js, sim/wildlife.js) need no
 * upgrade step: `military.people` missing is the scenario's people from
 * then on, and a raid such a save had scouted or under way is marked the
 * generic band it was (core/game.js); a save without `wildlife` has no
 * packs. Wolves
 * are units like any other (type 'wolf', side 'wild', with `pack`).
 *
 * Version history:
 *   1  first release
 *   2  military: units[], military (raid schedule + stats), wallHp[], map.wall.
 *      Version 1 saves load fine; the missing parts start empty.
 *   3  map layers may be PackBits-compressed ("pb:" + base64), and walker
 *      and soldier paths are stored as 16-bit values ("u16:" + base64). An
 *      Uber map (256x256) would otherwise spend ~600 KB of every save on
 *      layers that are mostly runs of the same byte, and long paths cost
 *      about 6 characters a step as JSON numbers. Older saves (plain base64
 *      layers, paths as arrays) load.
 *   4  the 20-level housing ladder (v0.7): house levels were renumbered and
 *      homes got new fields, so saves before version 4 are refused with a
 *      readable message (until 1.0, a release may break older saves).
 *   5  home mood and crime: homes have a mood, hunger streak, criminal flag
 *      and police timer; city.crime holds the year's counts; protesters,
 *      thieves and rioters are walkers. Version 4 saves load: every new field
 *      has a safe default (an occupied home starts at the city's mood, no
 *      flags, no police cover, no criminals about), see upgradeV4().
 *   6  disease: homes have a disease risk and sick days; city.health holds
 *      city health and the year's outbreaks; physicians can be on their way
 *      to a sick home. Version 5 (and 4) saves load: no home is sick, every
 *      risk starts at 0 and city health at its starting value, see
 *      upgradeV5().
 *   7  three changes in one release (v0.12), each loading older saves:
 *      - the original's five gods: Mercury and Venus took the places of two
 *        gods of Colonia's own, Jupiter and Vesta. Each god has an `angered`
 *        flag, and city.venusBoost is Venus's factor in the city mood.
 *        upgradeGodsV6() renames the old gods on the raw data before
 *        anything is built from it (their temples, their moods, every home's
 *        access to them, their priests), so no temple is dropped as an
 *        unknown building and no home loses a god.
 *      - storage orders: granaries and warehouses hold `orders` (per good
 *        'accept', 'refuse' or 'get') and an Empty switch (`emptying`) in
 *        place of the old `accept` flags; carts can be out fetching
 *        ('collect'). Each accept flag becomes Accept or Refuse and nothing
 *        is emptying, see upgradeOrdersV6().
 *      - ruins: rubble remembers what stood there, why it fell and when
 *        (ruins[]: one entry per fallen building with the tiles it still
 *        covers, see sim/ruins.js). Older saves load with rubble that has no
 *        record; its info panel says what it always said.
 *   8  ships wait at the dock while dock workers carry goods both ways
 *      (sim/trade.js): a moored ship holds what it still has to unload
 *      (`unload`), what it still wants (`wants`), its running `deal`, when
 *      it tied up (`mooredTick`) and its crane's progress; a dock worker
 *      fetching an export holds a `claim` and walks in state 'dockFetch'.
 *      A version 7 ship at the dock had traded everything on arrival (and
 *      was logged then): it loads with nothing left to trade and casts off
 *      on the first tick, see upgradeShipsV7(). Goods on a quay stay there
 *      and dock workers cart them on, as before.
 *   9  fish and the hippodrome: fish is a fifth food (every food list,
 *      granary, warehouse, market and dock stock and trade setting has it);
 *      shipyards, wharves and fishing boats (walkers) keep their state; a
 *      hippodrome is three linked buildings (`parts`, `main`); homes have
 *      hippodrome access and venues a hippodrome show count. Fishing grounds
 *      are derived from the terrain at load, never saved. Older saves load
 *      with no fish, no boats and the new keys at 0, see upgradeFishV8().
 *  10  the cloth industry: flax, linen and clothing are goods (every
 *      warehouse and dock stock and trade setting has them), homes and
 *      markets hold clothing, and homes need it from the Insula up. Older
 *      saves load with the new goods at 0 and no trade in them, see
 *      upgradeClothV9(); their Tenements and better homes start with three
 *      months of clothing, and fall back after that unless a market brings
 *      more.
 *  11  sea raids and the fleet (sim/navy.js): military.seaRaids (the
 *      switch), the fleet's demand and new stats; navalia (stock, progress)
 *      and naval stations (rally); liburnians (station, slot) and raider
 *      ships (crew, pots, route) are units; a raid by sea has `sea`,
 *      `landing`, `landed` and `landedDay`. Older saves load with no fleet,
 *      the switch on (the default) and any raid the scouts already saw
 *      coming by land as it was; the raids after it may come by sea, see
 *      upgradeNavyV10().
 *  12  training (sim/training.js), and large temples: soldiers and
 *      liburnians have a `trained` flag and, while on a trip to a Military
 *      Academy or the Portus, `drill` (its id), `drillDay` and `drillDays`
 *      (its time limit); a recruit walker may be on his way to an academy
 *      (state 'toAcademy', `academy`, then `trainedAt`) and carries `trained`; academies and the Portus count `trainedHere`,
 *      forts and stations hold `drillWait`. Large temples are new building
 *      types and need nothing. Older saves load with every soldier, ship and
 *      recruit untrained and nobody on a trip, see upgradeTrainingV11().
 *  13  the governor (sim/governor.js): city.governor holds his rank, the
 *      salary he draws (salaryRank), his personal savings and the salary
 *      paid this year; city.gifts counts his gifts to the Emperor within a
 *      year, in place of city.giftCooldown. Older saves load at the mission's rank (a
 *      sandbox at the middle rank), drawing its salary, with no savings, as
 *      if that salary had been paid since New Year (so the first New Year
 *      neither rewards nor punishes it), and a gift still cooling down
 *      counts as one gift sent that many months ago, see
 *      upgradeGovernorV12().
 *  14  Caesar's legions, distant battles and triumphal arches (favor 0 no
 *      longer recalls the governor): military.caesar (sim/legion.js: the
 *      legions' march, the army on the map, the count of attacks; imperial
 *      legionaries are units with `legion` and `waitTicks`), military.battle
 *      and military.battles (sim/battle.js: a call for troops, the troops
 *      away and their records), each fort's and station's Empire service
 *      switch (`service`), men and ships on their way out (`away`,
 *      `awayTick`), city.archesEarned, and triumphal arches (`axis`). Older
 *      saves load with no legions coming, no battle, no arches earned and
 *      every switch off; the population peak the overrun rule reads
 *      (city.stats.peakPopulation) starts again at today's population. See
 *      upgradeEmpireV13().
 *  15  staged warnings: military.warnStage (the warnings given for the coming
 *      raid: rumour, scouts' report, a month away; sim/military.js),
 *      warned.noShore (raider ships that found no landing a month out), and
 *      military.caesar.noticeStage (the legions' reminders, sim/legion.js).
 *      Messages may carry `empire` (a click opens the empire map). Older
 *      saves load with every stage whose moment has passed counted as given,
 *      so nothing is told late or twice, see upgradeWarningsV14().
 *  16  training takes time (sim/training.js): a recruit walker training at
 *      the academy is in state 'training' with `trainLeft` (ticks of
 *      training at full staff still to go) and `trainWait` (ticks waited
 *      for a full staff), and a new liburnian moored at the Portus has both
 *      too. Soldiers at rest no longer go to the
 *      academy. Older saves need nothing: nobody in them is mid-training
 *      (a recruit or ship still on its way trains on arrival), and a soldier
 *      caught on a trip to the academy comes straight home (updateRoman
 *      did it then; upgradeSoldierTripsV28 since version 29).
 *  17  shipyards need timber (sim/fishing.js; Colonia's own rule): a
 *      shipyard holds `stock.timber` and `incoming.timber`, and a boat takes
 *      100, used at launch. Older saves load with
 *      100 timber in a yard that has a boat started (progress above 0), so
 *      the boat on the slip finishes as it would have, and none in the
 *      others, see upgradeShipyardTimberV16().
 *  19  recall from a distant battle (sim/battle.js): military.recalls, a
 *      list of riders carrying a fort's or station's recall and of recalled
 *      troops on their way home, each { post, city, march, rider,
 *      riderTotal, homeIn, homeTotal, men, ships } (records like
 *      battle.sent's). Older saves load with no rider out and nobody
 *      recalled, see upgradeRecallsV18().
 *  20  horses live at the Horse Ranch, never in a warehouse (data/goods.js
 *      keptAt): a ranch has `incoming` (horses on their way to its stables),
 *      and a new warehouse's stock, incoming and orders have no horses (an
 *      upgraded one keeps a horses entry in stock and incoming, for the old
 *      save's carts still on the road, but no order). An older
 *      save's warehouse horses move to ranches with room, in id order (the
 *      roads are not built yet while a save loads); what no ranch has room for
 *      stays at its warehouse, which sends it to a barracks that needs it or
 *      a ranch with room, a horse a day (sim/production.js). The warehouse's
 *      horse order is dropped. See upgradeHorsesV19().
 *  21  trade by partner (sim/tradeSwitches.js): each trade route holds
 *      `off`, { good: true } for the goods the player switched off with
 *      that partner. Older saves load with every switch on (an empty `off`
 *      on every route), so they trade as before, see
 *      upgradeTradeSwitchesV20().
 *  23  everything since 22, in one step:
 *      - events (sim/events.js): city.romeWage (what Rome pays, which random
 *      events move) and city.events (each event's cooldown, the day land and
 *      sea trade may start again, the earthquake in progress with its cracks'
 *      ends, the counts). The cracks themselves are rock in the map. Older
 *      saves load with Rome at the base wage, nothing cooling down, trade
 *      open and no quake, see upgradeEventsV22() (the Game constructor
 *      fills the same defaults, so a save without them loads either way).
 *      - raiders' peoples, wolf packs and the gladiator revolt
 *        (data/peoples.js, sim/wildlife.js, sim/revolt.js): see above; no
 *        step needed.
 *      - low bridges (sim/bridges.js): map.bridgeLow, 1 on a low bridge's
 *        tiles. A v22 save has no layer: every bridge is a ship bridge, as
 *        it was.
 *      - native villages (sim/natives.js): city.natives (null without
 *        villages, as in every v22 save: the Game constructor fills it),
 *        village buildings (kind 'village', ids from NATIVE_ID_BASE, with
 *        anger and their attack), villagers (units, side 'native'), the
 *        mission post, missionaries and village traders.
 *  24  the sandbox's events, one switch each (data/events.js): a sandbox
 *      scenario's `events` is the list of switches left on, where it was
 *      one switch (true, false, or missing before events). An older
 *      sandbox with its events on (or from before them) gets every switch
 *      on, one with them off none, see upgradeEventSwitchesV23(). Campaign
 *      saves store only the mission id and are unchanged.
 *  25  numbered forts (sim/fortNumbers.js): each fort holds its `number`
 *      (Castra III; Shift+3 shows it), the lowest free one when it was
 *      placed. Older saves number their forts 1, 2, 3... in id order, the
 *      order they were built, see upgradeFortNumbersV24().
 *  26  gardens and statues fade untended (sim/gardens.js): each garden and
 *      statue holds `tendedDay` (the day a gardener last passed) and
 *      `careStep` (how far its desirability has faded). An older save's
 *      start fully tended, last visited the day it loads, see
 *      upgradeGardensV25().
 *  27  festivals cost goods and the gods mind being forgotten
 *      (sim/religion.js): each god in city.gods has `monthsSinceFestival`
 *      (its mood target falls once it passes a year) and `festivalsHeld`.
 *      Older saves load as a new game starts: every god at 0 months, a
 *      fresh year, with none held yet, see upgradeFestivalsV26().
 *  28  a prefect fights one burning building at a time (sim/risk.js): each
 *      entry of fires[] is [tile, days left, fire], the fire being the id
 *      of the building that burned there, so a building's tiles go out
 *      together; a prefect at a fire holds it in fireTile, waiting with
 *      afterWait 'douse'. Older saves tie burning tiles together by the
 *      ruin they share, see upgradeFireGroupsV27().
 *  29  soldiers at rest go to train (sim/training.js): a soldier on a trip
 *      from his fort to the Campus holds `drill` (its id), `drillDay` and
 *      `drillDays`, and there `trainLeft` and `trainWait`, as a ship on its
 *      way to the Portus does; a fort or station may hold `drillWait` (no
 *      trip before that day). In an older save a soldier could hold a trip
 *      only from before version 16, when it meant something else: he comes
 *      straight home, untrained, see upgradeSoldierTripsV28().
 *  30  waterside buildings stand out over the water (sim/entities.js
 *      waterRowsFor): a building's front rows may stand on water tiles,
 *      which no boat sails through, and its berth, slip or mooring lies
 *      just past them. A building's `waterRows` is derived from the
 *      terrain as the save loads, whatever the file says. Every waterside
 *      building in an older save stands wholly on land: it keeps its
 *      berth and its look, and works as it did, so no step is needed. The
 *      version moves so that a game from before the rule refuses a newer
 *      save rather than loading buildings on water it would let ships sail
 *      through.
 *  31  monuments (sim/monuments.js): a monument's building holds `mon` (its
 *      stage, work done, goods delivered and on their way, paid, halted,
 *      store, sacked), a work camp's `camp` (larder, water, food, supply
 *      factor, its crew's state), a camp's cart its `campClaim` and a
 *      reservation marked `mon` at the site; the finance ledger has a
 *      'monuments' row (upkeep). An older save has none of them: its
 *      ledgers get the row at 0, see upgradeMonumentsV30().
 *
 * Typed-array map layers are base64 encoded, run-length compressed first
 * when that is smaller (encodeLayer). Derived data (building tile layer,
 * desirability, water coverage, road networks) is rebuilt on load.
 *
 * Browser storage: localStorage key `colonia.save.<slot>`. Every read/write
 * is wrapped in try/catch because storage can be missing, full or blocked.
 * Slots: auto (monthly + when the page is hidden/closed), quick (F5),
 * slot1..slot5 (manual). localStorage belongs to this browser and site only:
 * clearing site data deletes the saves, so the menus offer export/copy.
