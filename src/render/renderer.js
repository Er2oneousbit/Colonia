/**
 * renderer.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Draws the city every frame.
 *
 * Passes:
 *   1. Ground: terrain tiles, shorelines, roads, plazas, bridges, rubble and
 *      overlay tints. Flat things never overlap each other, so order is free.
 *   2. Objects: trees, rocks, aqueducts, walls, buildings, walkers, soldiers,
 *      raiders, ships of war, missiles, rally flags, flames, overlay columns. Sorted
 *      back-to-front by "depth" (x + y of their front point).
 *
 * Multi-tile buildings are drawn as vertical strips half a tile wide. Each
 * strip is sorted by the front-most footprint tile it covers. This is the
 * classic trick that lets walkers pass correctly in front of and behind
 * big buildings with a simple depth sort.
 *
 *   3. Tool previews (ghost building, green/red tiles), hover and selection.
 *      A building placed where no road would touch it is drawn in the
 *      warning color, with the edge tiles where a road would serve it
 *      picked out. Just before this pass, a red "no road" sign floats over
 *      every building that has no road to use (drawn over the night and the
 *      weather, at a size that stays readable when zoomed far out).
 *      Water buildings show their supply area: the one being placed or the
 *      one clicked in dark blue, existing coverage of that kind in pale blue.
 *   4. Particles (dust, smoke).
 *
 * Life in the picture (all visual only): buildings cast soft shadows to the
 * lower right, new buildings rise out of a puff of dust, forests sway in
 * gusts that roll across the map, water glints, fountains spray, fires glow
 * and throw embers, and (ambient.js) cloud shadows drift over the city while
 * birds fly past. `ambientOn` / `motionOn` switch the optional parts off
 * (Settings, or the system's reduced-motion preference).
 *
 * The world around the city (all optional, see Settings):
 *   - day and night (lighting.js, `dayNightOn`): the scene is tinted by the
 *     time of day, and after dusk windows, torches, lanterns and fires light
 *     it up. Drawn after the particles, before tool previews, so previews
 *     and selection outlines always stay easy to read.
 *   - seasons (weather.js, `seasonsOn`): ground and tree colors follow the
 *     month; last month's sprites are dropped as the month turns.
 *   - weather (weather.js, `weatherOn`): overcast dims the scene and hides
 *     sun shadows; rain, snow and lightning are drawn over the world.
 * Where two kinds of ground meet, blend sprites soften the edge (the codes
 * are cached per tile until the map changes).
 *
 * The view turn (view.js, `camera.turn`): the city can be seen from any of
 * its four sides. Everything here is drawn in view tiles: the ground pass
 * walks the view's rows and finds each map tile through `tileAxes`, depth is
 * the view's x + y, neighbour masks (roads, shores, walls, aqueducts, blends)
 * are worked out on the map and rotated (`rotMask`), so the sprites and their
 * keys are those of a turn-0 tile of that shape, and a building is drawn with
 * its art turned by `b.turn + view turn` (render/turn.js) at its footprint's
 * view corner (`viewFoot`).
 *
 * Back ends: this file works out WHAT to draw (the visible range, the ground
 * sprites, the depth-sorted items with their sprites and strips, render/
 * items.js) and hands it to a back end that draws it: the Classic one on the
 * 2D canvas (canvasBackend.js, the default), or the WebGL one (render3d/
 * webglBackend.js), which can draw a building as a 3D model. With Classic,
 * everything after the sorted objects (particles, gulls, clouds, the night,
 * the weather, the signs, tool previews and selection outlines) is drawn
 * here on #view. The WebGL one draws on its own canvas on the page and is
 * handed the layers under the night (`post`: particles to the flash) to
 * draw itself; the rest is drawn here on a transparent 2D canvas over it
 * (`mountLayers`, `useLayers`), and #view stays on top, see-through,
 * taking the input.
