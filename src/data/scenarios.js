 *

 * linen was the finest in the Mediterranean (Alexandria sells the most), and
 * Hispania's coast round Tarraco wove linen of its own; rich Capua and
 * Corinthus buy clothing. A mission whose homes can reach the Insula, where
 * clothing is first needed, also unlocks the Linarium, Textrinum and
 * Taberna Vestiaria (TIER4 on), so linen bought in only saves a flax field.
 *
 * Three partners for the late campaign, by sea from the far ends of the sea:
 * Gades, the Phoenician port beyond the Pillars of Hercules and Rome's ally
 * from 206 BC (its olives and the iron of Hispania's mines); Rhodus, the
 * trading republic and its wine, hungry for grain, timber and iron for its
 * fleet; and Delos, a free port from 166 BC, the market of the Aegean. They
 * buy on the original's quota tiers (1,500, 2,500 and 4,000 a year, see
 * sim/tradeDemand.js), and so do the late missions' own `demand` fields; a
 * route this busy sends its ships more often. Urbs Magna keeps the nine it
 * always had (its list is written out), the sandbox has all twelve.

/*
 * The campaign's goals. Population: about a third of the plebeians look for
 * work, and above 10% unemployment the city's mood falls and peace stops
 * growing, so a goal of more people than the mission's buildings employ
 * cannot be met by a well run city. Mission 1 once asked for 1,200 people
 * when a sensible town of its buildings has about 100 jobs. Missions 1 and 2
 * ask for what a sensibly built town employs: measured with the demo city
 * (`npm run sim -- --scenario c1 --unlocks --homes 40`: 312 people, 4% out
 * of work) and held under the capacity model's sensible ceiling by a test
 * (sim/capacity.js, `npm run sim -- --capacity`); mission 2's 450 was set
 * before the Curia came to it, whose 30 jobs lift its ceiling to 550, so a
 * town that builds one has room to spare. The military provinces of
 * steps 3 to 7 ask for a little under what a city of working homes alone
 * employs, or less; the model now counts a few villas too, which leaves
 * them room to spare. Portus Mercatorum asks for 3,900, the most that keeps
 * it within Oasis Aurea's pace, so that Beneventum beside it can ask for
 * more. The peaceful provinces ask for more people than their military
 * partner at every step (about a fifth more at steps 3 to 5), and from
 * step 3 for 83 to 90% of the model's sensible ceiling (85 to 90% at
 * steps 3 to 5; Figlina rose to 1,400 when the Curia's jobs came to the
 * missions before step 5; the gardeners' yards lifted the late ceilings), villas
 * counted (never more than 92%: the villa quarter is the model's riskiest
 * assumption), with demand of their own on the original's tiers where
 * their buildings alone do not give the work (Figlina, Beneventum and each
 * province from step 6). The last step is the longest.
 *
 * Favor: Caesar watches from step 3. Favor starts at 50 and drifts back
 * toward it, so a goal below 50 (30 at step 3, 35 at Pons Aelius, 40 at
 * Paestum) asks the governor to keep it: missed requests, unpaid tribute,
 * debt and an unanswered call for troops lose it, and requests met, the
 * tribute and gifts win it back. From step 5 the goals ask for more than
 * 50, which requests, gifts and, in a military province, battles won and
 * raids repelled earn.
 *
 * Length: each mission's goals are set so the fastest possible city takes the
 * mission's paceYears (sim/pace.js). In the missions of steps 1 to 4 and in
 * Oasis Aurea peace sets it (a point a month from 20); in the others, the
 * population.
 *
 * The homes follow the housing ladder: what the unlocked buildings let homes
 * reach (Huts in the first mission, Townhouses in the second, Domus in the
 * third, Villas in the fourth, then everything). The third mission has the
