/**
 * peoples.js (data)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Who raids a province. Each mission's warbands come from a real people of
 * its place and time (the third and second centuries BC): Gauls from the
 * north, Ligurians from the hills, Carthaginians with Numidian horse in the
 * south, Lusitanians in Hispania, the Cimbri and Teutones in Gaul. A people
 * brings its own kinds of warrior in its own shares, goes for its own kind
 * of target and breaks at its own losses (sim/military.js).
 *
 * People fields:
 *   name     the people, for messages and panels ("Ligurians")
 *   one      one of them ("a Ligurian" is `a ${one}`)
 *   mix      { unit type: share in percent } (data/units.js), one roll per
 *            man; null = the generic warband (sim/combat.js warbandType:
 *            raiders, horsemen from 1,200 people, slingers from 700)
 *   target   what the warband makes for first (sim/field.js raidTargets):
 *              nearest  the nearest building of any kind (as before peoples)
 *              food     granaries, warehouses, markets, then farms
 *              homes    the governor's residence, then the best homes
 *              troops   forts, barracks, the academy, prefectures
 *              stores   warehouses and granaries
 *              random   one of the four above, drawn for each raid
 *            With none of them standing, any building, as before. On the
 *            way, a building beside a warrior is still struck.
 *   breaks   the warband flees once no more than this share of it is left:
 *            0.3 = it breaks after 70% losses (the generic band). The
 *            original's morale caps read as shares: mobs break sooner, the
 *            disciplined later.
 *   missilesAtWalkers  its missile men (slingers, javelineers) strike the
 *            city's people in the street when the city has fewer than
 *            WALKER_TARGET_SOLDIERS soldiers (the original's rule)
 *   desc     a line for the Military advisor
 *
 * A warband's size is scaled so that its strength (the sum of health x
 * attack over its men, sim/military.js peopleSize) matches the generic
 * band's: a people of fewer, harder men sends fewer of them, so each
 * mission's raids weigh what they did before peoples, give or take a man.
 *
 * Which people a game faces (sim/military.js peopleFor): a mission's own
 * (PEOPLE_BY_MISSION); else its site's (PEOPLE_BY_SITE); the sandbox meets
 * the generic band unless its setup asks for the province's own people
 * (scenario `raiders: 'site'`). Nothing here is saved but the people's id
 * (military.people, and each raid's `people`).
