/**
 * housing.js (data)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The housing ladder: 20 levels, from a tent to an imperial palace. A housing
 * plot starts as a vacant lot (level 0); settlers make it a Tent. The rules
 * that move a home up and down the ladder live in sim/housing.js.
 *
 * Footprints: levels 1-10 are single tiles (four neighbors of the same level
 * may join into one 2x2 "block" that still counts as that level), 11-14 are
 * 2x2, 15-18 are 3x3 and 19-20 are 4x4. A home grows into the bigger
 * footprint as it reaches 11, 15 and 19, and splits again if it falls back.
 *
 * Requirement fields: a home must meet its own level's needs to stay, and the
 * next level's needs to move up. All are "at least":
 *   water     1 = a well or a fountain, 2 = a fountain
 *   food      different food types in the pantry
 *   religion  different gods whose priests visited recently
 *   ent       entertainment score (see sim/housing.js entertainmentScore)
 *   edu       education tier: 1 = school or library, 2 = both,
 *             3 = school, library and academy
 *   barber    1 = a barber visited recently
 *   baths     1 = a bath attendant visited recently
 *   health    health tier: 1 = a medicus or a hospital, 2 = both
 *   goods     goods the household must have in stock
 *   wine      wine sources the CITY must have (a working winery, and each
 *             open trade partner selling wine while wine is set to import)
 *
 * Desirability: `up` is what a home needs (at least) to move up from this
 * level; at `down` or below it has a bad day. The gap between them keeps a
 * home that just moved up from falling straight back. It is wider (6) where a
 * home grows into a bigger footprint (11, 15, 19): the neighbors it takes
 * over stop adding their own desirability to its best tile.
 *
 * Other fields:
 *   size       footprint of the level (1, 2, 3 or 4)
 *   people     residents of one home at this level (per tile for single-tile
 *              levels, so a 2x2 block of them holds four times as many)
 *   tax        base tax per resident per year (before the tax rate)
 *   patrician  true = wealthy residents who do not work
 *   eats       false = forages: needs and eats no food (the two tent levels)
 *   fire/damage risk points per day (tents never collapse)
 *   desOut     desirability the home gives its neighbors [value, step, stepSize, range]
