/**
 * units.js (data)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Combat unit definitions for both sides. Units are separate from walkers:
 * walkers stay on roads, units move freely over open land and fight.
 *
 * Timing: speed is tiles per tick (20 ticks = 1 game day, 1.67 s at 1x),
 * cooldown is ticks between attacks.
 *
 *   hp        hit points
 *   attack    damage per hit before defense (randomized +-25%)
 *   defense   each point removes half a point of incoming damage
 *   range     attack reach in tiles (about 1 = melee)
 *   aggro     distance at which the unit notices and engages enemies
 *   siege     damage per hit against buildings and walls (raiders only)
 *   naval     a ship: sails navigable water only and fights only ships
 *             (sim/navy.js); land soldiers and raiders ignore it
 *   upkeep    Dn per month to keep one soldier (Roman units only). Kept low:
 *             forts and the barracks already cost wages for their staff.
 *   color     tunic/banner color (forts fly their soldiers' color)
 *
 * Training (a Military Academy for soldiers, the Portus for liburnian crews;
 * sim/training.js). A trained man or crew keeps its hp and attack, as in the
 * original, and gains:
 *   trainedDefense   defense added at all times
 *   holdDefense      defense added while holding position: standing his ground
 *                    (at his post, or standing to fight a raider in reach), not
 *                    running after one or marching. The original's close order.
 *   holdMissile      share of a missile's damage taken while holding position
 *                    (the original's close order took 1 damage a missile)
 *   trainedRam       ram damage of a trained crew
 *   trainedSpeed     speed of a trained crew (they row in time)
 *   strength,        what one counts for in a distant battle, untrained and
 *   trainedStrength  trained (battleStrength in sim/training.js): the
 *                    original's legionary 2 or 3 and auxiliary 1 or 2, and a
 *                    liburnian 4 or 6 (Colonia's own)
