 * difficulty.js (data)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Difficulty levels. Every lever the simulation reads lives in this one
 * table, so a level can be understood (and rebalanced) in one place.
 * Multipliers are relative to Normal (1 = no change); only `mood` is in points.
 *
 *   funds            starting treasury (sandbox and campaign)
 *   risk             how fast fire and collapse risk builds up
 *   production       farm, raw material and workshop speed
 *   immigration      settlers arriving per day
 *   mood             flat city-mood points (shown in the Overview advisor)
 *   winterGrowth     farm growth in winter (December to Februarius, x production):
 *                    1 = as the rest of the year, 0 = fields and herds rest until Martius
 *   raidSize         raiders per warband
 *   raidInterval     months until the first raid and between raids
 *   enemy            raider health and attack (and damage to buildings)
 *   requestSize      size of the Emperor's requests (goods and money)
 *   requestInterval  months between the Emperor's requests
 *   requestTime      months to deliver a request (x CONFIG.REQUEST_DEADLINE_MONTHS)
 *   devolveDays      bad days in a row before a home falls back a level (in days, not
 *                    a multiplier): 3 as in the original game, more forgiving on Easy
 *   crime            the daily chance that an unhappy home breeds a protester, a
 *                    thief or a riot (sim/crime.js)
 *   crimePeace       what crime costs in peace: a riot x CONFIG.RIOT_PEACE, a thief
 *                    x CONFIG.THIEF_PEACE at once and, above 0, that month's gain
 *   protestPeaceEvery  every this many protests cost CONFIG.PROTEST_PEACE, then the
 *                    count starts again (0: protests never cost peace)
 *   disease          how fast unhealthy homes build disease risk (sim/disease.js)
 *   winterTrade      how much longer caravans and ships take to come in winter
 *                    (December to Februarius): 2 = half as many visits (sim/trade.js)
 *   loanInterest     what a loan from Rome costs, over its whole term (0.2: 20%;
 *                    sim/loans.js)
 *   wolfBite         a wolf's bite against a walker's 20 health (sim/wildlife.js;
 *                    in points, not a multiplier): a walker dies in 5 bites on
 *                    Easy, 4 on Normal, 3 on Hard and Insane (the original's
 *                    4, 6, 8 and 8)
 *   legionHalt,      favor bands for Caesar's legions on the map (sim/legion.js,
 *   legionHome       in points, not multipliers): at legionHome or more they
 *                    march home, at legionHalt or more (in the siege's first
 *                    year) they halt where they stand, below it they attack.
 *                    The original's bands came in the wrong order (high favor
 *                    only halted them); these are the sane order, with the
 *                    later community engine's numbers per level. The army's
 *                    size scales with raidSize (CONFIG.LEGION_SIZES).
 *   events           how often the monthly random events come (sim/events.js): the
 *                    share of the original's table that draws an event (0.5: half
 *                    as often, 1.5: half again as often)
 *   eventCooldown    months before the same random event can come again (the
 *                    original had none; these are the later community engine's
 *                    numbers). Rome's wages always wait 12 (data/events.js)
 *   careFade         how fast an untended garden or statue loses its
 *                    desirability once its month of grace is over (sim/gardens.js;
 *                    CONFIG.CARE_STEP_DAYS / careFade days a step): half as
 *                    fast on Easy, half again as fast on Insane. The grace
 *                    and the floor stay the same
 *   monumentUpkeep   a finished monument's monthly upkeep in Dn (data/monuments.js
 *                    `upkeep`), times this: half on Easy, a quarter more on Hard,
 *                    half again on Insane
 *   monumentRaze     raiders who bring a monument (a site at any stage, or a
 *                    finished one) to 0 hit points raze it to rubble, everything
 *                    built and delivered lost (Insane only). Elsewhere a raid
 *                    sets a site back (half the stage's work, a quarter of its
 *                    goods; finished stages stand) and closes a finished one
 *                    until it is patched up (sim/monuments.js monumentStruck)
 *
 * Easy, Normal and Hard only use the first four levers plus raid size, crime,
 * crimePeace, disease, the two event levers and careFade (and Easy a longer devolveDays);
 * Insane pulls on all of them.
 *
 * Crime and peace: none on Easy, a little on Normal, some on
 * Hard, a lot on Insane. Protests only cost on Insane, and only every fifth:
 * even a well-run Insane city sees about 17 a year, so a cost for each would
 * take peace down faster than its 12 a year can grow; one in five costs about
 * 3 a year, a steady hurt that a content city still climbs through. Balance check:
 * `npm run sim -- --difficulty insane` (scripts/simulate.mjs).
 *
 * Tuning notes (Insane, demo city over 12 maps, 4 years, no raids): risk 1.7
 * made a third of cities spiral (key service buildings burn or collapse
 * before the slower trickle of settlers can staff them), so it is 1.5: the
 * city ends about 2/3 the size of Normal's. With raids, the raid levers
 * matter less than the weaker economy; 1.5 x size, 1.15 x strength and 25%
 * shorter gaps need roughly twice Normal's army.
 *
 * Easy (demo city, 12 maps, 3 years): risk 0.7 meant 2.8 fires and 0.3
 * collapses per city, the first around month 17; 0.5 brings that to 0.6 and
 * 0.1, and most cities never have one.
