/**
 * goods.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every tradeable/storable resource.
 *
 *   kind:  'food'  eaten by houses, stored in granaries (and warehouses)
 *          'raw'   raw materials for workshops, stored in warehouses. Linen
 *                  is one too, though a workshop makes it: what makes a good
 *                  'raw' is that a workshop works it up, so carts take it to
 *                  a Clothing Maker first and warehouses forward it to one
 *          'goods' manufactured goods houses want, stored in warehouses
 *   buy:   Dn the city PAYS per cart (100 units) when importing
 *   sell:  Dn the city EARNS per cart when exporting
 *   color: used for cart cargo, warehouse stacks and UI chips
 *   keptAt: (horses) the building type that keeps this good instead of a
 *          warehouse: horses live in the Horse Ranch's stables. Warehouses
 *          never take it; trade, the Emperor and the city's stock counts
 *          use those buildings as its store (sim/storage.js)
