/**
 * gods.js
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The five patron gods of the colony, the original game's five, in its order
 * (the advisor lists them in this order, and the monthly update visits them
 * in it). Each has a temple, a mood (0-100) and a blessing and a wrath,
 * handled in sim/religion.js.
 *
 * color: the priest's tunic, the advisor heading and the temple's pediment
 * (render/buildingArt.js TEMPLE_LOOKS), so each must stand apart from the
 * other four at a glance.
 * harderWrath: angered again before it calms, the god strikes harder (the
 * original's major curse; sim/religion.js). The other gods strike the same.
 *
 * Saves before version 7 had two other gods where Mercury and Venus are
 * now; the loader moves their state over (core/save.js upgradeGodsV6).
